There are three things we can do with risk,
Accept it,
Transfer it (insurance),
Reduce it

Residual risk is the amount of risk that remains after security measures
have been applied.

Information security------------------------------------------------------
Information security is all about protective measures.

Some types of protective measures:
Preventative measures (prevent damage),
Detective measures (know when, how and who caused damage),
Reactive measures (allow recovery to assets)

information security is about dealing with potential damages.

Information security can be categorised into the CIA triad:
Confidentiality, Privacy and Secrecy (prevent unauthorised disclosure of information),
Integrity (Prevent unauthorised modification of information),
Availability (prevent unauthorised witholding of information i.e. DoS),

The above three aspects along with the bottom two make up the main
concepts of information security.
Authenticity (make sure the author/sender is as claimed),
Non-repudiation (people can't escape contracts by claiming that it was a forgery)

Risk management------------------------------------------------------------
The process concerned with identification, measurements, control and
minimisation of security risks in information systems to a level appropriate
to what the asset is worth.

Risk management helps determine and optimise for the appropriate cost/benefit
for protective measures.

Identify, measure, control and minimise or eliminate attacks.
This is done through: risk assessment, cost benefit analysis, selection,
implementation and evaluation of security features and countermeasures and
an overall security review.

The definition of risk as determined by ISO/IEC 27000:2018 is,
"effect of uncertainty of objectives". Where an objective is a result to
be achieved.

The definition of threat as determined by ISO/IEC 27000:2018 is,
"potential cause of an unwanted incident, which can result in harm to a system
or organization"

The definition of vulnerability as determined by ISO/IEC 27000:2018 is,
"weakness of an asset or control that can be exploited by one or more
threats"

The definition of risk assessment as determined by ISO/IEC 27000:2018 is,
"overall process of risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation."

Risk analysis----------------------------------------------------------------
A model for quantifying the cost is taking the expected value of the
event occuring (prob * impact).

ARO (Annualised Rate of Occurrence)
Number of times a year.

SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
The impact of a single type of this event occurring.

ALE (Annualised Loss Expectancy)
ALE = ARO * SLE
