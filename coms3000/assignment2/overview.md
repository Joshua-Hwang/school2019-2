# The plan
We will choose Recommended controls to secure information in the cloud

There should be some references in the downloads/coms3000/references
folder for you

We **need** world-wide data from the past year (Jan 2018).
Bonus points for Australian data from the past year (Jan 2018).
Please don't forget the IEEE reference style.

At least one of the sources **must** have been peer-reviewed.

We aim to follow the structure:
1. Threat (what could impact our business e.g. loss of internet, loss of data)
 * Why is it a threat and how is it "unique" to the cloud computing industry
2. Vulnerabilities (what in our system could make this threat realised)
 * Why is it a vulnerability
3. Exploits (A method of using the vulnerability to acheive the threat)
4. How to prevent the threat from occurring.
 * Keep in mind mitigating RISK

Rinse and repeat for the remaining parts. This must be done AT LEAST TWICE.
