There are a few spelling and grammar errors in this document I would be
wary of its validity.

There's a bunch of nice issues to look at
Multi tenancy and elasticity

Many people sometimes sharing the same resources.
This means that information leakage is possible.
This can be controlled by data encryption


Since we're using a non-local solution we also have new networking
threats and issues
MITM attacks
DDOS attacks
These can be controlled with
authentication, authorization and accounting

41% of commercial entities run significant workload on public clouds.
49% of the businesses are delaying cloud deployment due to security skill gap
and concerns.

Urgent problems include
Privileged User Access Management
Regulartory Compliance
Data Location
Data Segregation
Data Protection and Recovery Support
Investigate Support
Long-term Viability

Certain types of cloud service models may put security responsibility into the
hands of the provider and customer equally or entirely on the cloud provider.
This could be risky if the cloud provider is not held accountable for their
security.

Shared technology vulnerability since the cloud provider is using a single
piece of technology to handle the cloud it gives attackers a single point
of attack to potentially damage numerous clients.

Data breach is now commonly the issue of the provider. This would be fine if
the cloud provider we choose is respectable. This will require work on our end.

Account of Service traffic hijacking. Though our services may be accessed
through the internet (which is nice) it does mean our services (that have
not been hardened) are at a higher risk of attacks.

Denial of Service. Since we're on the internet we may lose access to our own
platform.

Malicious insider. A determined insider can find more ways to attack and cover
their tracks in the cloud. Especially if they are employees of the cloud
provider.

We must now use the internet stack with all it's vulnerabilities and well
studied attacks present. IP spoofing, ARP spoofing, DNS Poisoning.

The three major vectors of attack are network, hypervisor and hardware.

We control these via:
End to end encryption
Scanning for malicious activities
The cloud provider needs to ensure the cloud consumers are behaving.
Ensure APIs are secure
Cloud provider needs to screen their employees
Business continuity plans which document organisation response to incidents

Talks about how to run controls so risk is mitigated on all ends.
This is done by end to end encryption (stops malicious insider at the cloud
provider)
SSL to ensure our move to the open internet affects our communications to our
services.
Finally login details are required for access to the services.

Note this paper is from 2010

It seems to echo the same issues 1-s2.0-S1877050917313030-main.pdf had.
Traditionally we could employ a strong security policy which locked down
all unnecessary attack vectors. In the public cloud, the data and process owners
are not the infrastructure owners. This means we must trust our cloud
providers.
It's important to note that a private cloud is owned by the company so in this
case nothing has changed.

The proposed control measure is to introduce a Trusted Third Party.

Due to virtual separation of logical drives and lack of hardware separation
between multiple users on a single infrastructure, data remanence may lead to
the unwilling disclosure of private data. Also a malicious user may claim
a large amount of disk space and scavenge for sensitive data.

In cloud computing, the data is distributed over the number of regions and to
find the location of data is difficult. When the data is moved to different
geographical locations the laws governing on that data can also change. So there
is an issue of compliance and data privacy laws in cloud computing.

If the data center is hit by a natural disaster and the cloud provider
failed to provide offsite backups then they are liable for the loss of data.

mcd2018010060.pdf---------------------------------------------------------------
Current Australian paper on the topic but not statistics.
Talks about high level controls that can automatically reduce the impact
of attacks. Even how to handle zero day attacks.

8167.0 - Characteristics of Australian Business , 2017-18.html------------------
11% of businesses reported they had an internet security breach
Manufacturing and wholesale were the worst with 18%
52% say the worst impact of the breach was downtime of the service
52% of larger companies (200+ employees) upgraded their cyber security policies
and standards this is an up from 2015-2016 which was only 34%.

Cloud climbs to new heights in Australia as market g...-------------------------
77% of companies using cloud use at least two providers.
49% use four or more. This is a huge risk in trust.

36% of companies place no policy on cloud.

Highly polarising:
40% considered moving to cloud a more secure option while
42% held off on cloud for security reasons

37% of large organisations outsource cloud MANAGEMENT to third parties.

Roughly half of organisations interviewed believed their cloud computing
practices were compliant with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).
An EU data protection law.

Deloitte_ Australian cloud productivity worth $9.4 billio...--------------------
It seems the most used application of the cloud is the scaling of resources
dependent on the resources used [real numbers provided]
Though this may be great for finance it is a major risk for security.
Since we're using shared resources on a public cloud it is likely (if the
cloud provider isn't doing their due diligence) to have sensitive data leaked.
