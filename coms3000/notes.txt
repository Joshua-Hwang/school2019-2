There are three things we can do with risk,
Accept it,
Transfer it (insurance),
Reduce it

Residual risk is the amount of risk that remains after security measures
have been applied.

Information security------------------------------------------------------
Information security is all about protective measures.

Some types of protective measures:
Preventative measures (prevent damage),
Detective measures (know when, how and who caused damage),
Reactive measures (allow recovery to assets)

information security is about dealing with potential damages.

Information security can be categorised into the CIA triad:
Confidentiality, Privacy and Secrecy (prevent unauthorised disclosure of information),
Integrity (Prevent unauthorised modification of information),
Availability (prevent unauthorised witholding of information i.e. DoS),

The above three aspects along with the bottom two make up the main
concepts of information security.
Authenticity (make sure the author/sender is as claimed),
Non-repudiation (people can't escape contracts by claiming that it was a forgery)

Risk management------------------------------------------------------------
The process concerned with identification, measurements, control and
minimisation of security risks in information systems to a level appropriate
to what the asset is worth.

Risk management helps determine and optimise for the appropriate cost/benefit
for protective measures.

Identify, measure, control and minimise or eliminate attacks.
This is done through: risk assessment, cost benefit analysis, selection,
implementation and evaluation of security features and countermeasures and
an overall security review.

The definition of risk as determined by ISO/IEC 27000:2018 is,
"effect of uncertainty of objectives". Where an objective is a result to
be achieved.

The definition of threat as determined by ISO/IEC 27000:2018 is,
"potential cause of an unwanted incident, which can result in harm to a system
or organization"

The definition of vulnerability as determined by ISO/IEC 27000:2018 is,
"weakness of an asset or control that can be exploited by one or more
threats"

The definition of risk assessment as determined by ISO/IEC 27000:2018 is,
"overall process of risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation."

Risk analysis----------------------------------------------------------------
A qunatitative risk analysis largely resolves around the following.
A model for quantifying the cost is taking the expected value of the
event occuring (prob * impact).

ARO (Annualised Rate of Occurrence)
Number of times a year.

SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
The impact of a single type of this event occurring.

ALE (Annualised Loss Expectancy)
ALE = ARO * SLE

It is often difficult however to get these probabilities and also to
quantify the impact and cost of an event.

Instead we might use a more qualitative method.
Risk assessment matrices.

Trust------------------------------------------------------------------------
When an entity is trusted is different than if they are trustworthy.
Hopefully the difference is obvious.

Direct trust can be developed by two parties.

Indirect trust involves trusting a third party who claims others are trustworthy.

Access Control----------------------------------------------------------------
There are two separate but important functions to establish identity:
Establishing the identity which involves:
    Identification - Determine who the entity is
    Authentication - Verity and prove you are who you say you are.
Authorisation, once identity is established a decision can be made about
granting or denying access.

Most access control is determined by identity. Which has a second benefit of
accountability (we can track who did what when in the system).

How do you prove (authenticate) your identity?--------------------------------
Passwords have been the goto for years. It is based on "something you know"

The problems include:
forgetting passwords
same password in multiple places
weak passwords
passwords not kept secret
default passwords

Passwords can be
guessed via bruteforce
social engineering and phising attacks
eavesdropping
bogus (fake) interfaces which look like login screens
keylogging

Storing passwords also leads to a point of vulnerability.

Cryptography------------------------------------------------------------------
Cryptography is about keeping messages secure.
Literally means secret writing.

Cyrptanalysis is the science of breaking message security.

Cryptology is the theory associated with cryptography and cryptanalysis.

The aim of cryptography is confidentiality but it can also be used to
authenticate a user, ensure no messages have been modified and
might even be used for digital signing.

Hash functions----------------------------------------------------------------
hash functions compress an arbitrarily long input x into a fixed size output.
hash functions should be designed to be easy to compute.

one-way hash functions have the one-way property. It is computationally
infeasable to find x given h(x). One-way is also called pre-image resistance.

Now cryptographic one-way functions have another property called
collision resistance.
Strong collision resistance means its hard to find two distinct x1 and x2 such that h(x1) = h(x2)
Weak collision resistance (aka 2nd pre-image resistance) given a specific
y=h(x1) it is hard to find x2 such that h(x1) = h(x2)

Cryptography keys------------------------------------------------------------
The problem with using a different and hidden protocol for all communications
between people is that no one can talk to new people. Instead we have
cryptography keys which alter the algorithm in a way that still ensures it's
impractical to crack. This is Kerckhoff's Principle,
    "The security of a cipher should rely on the secrecy of the key only."
