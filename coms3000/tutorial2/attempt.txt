Q1)
* Customer/user personal details. Customer faith in our business.
    Potential lawsuits if we didn't do our due diligence.
* Propreitary source code. We can no longer sell our product.
* Company e-mails. Damning corporate secrets could be leaked.

Q2)
Quantitative allows us to put an exact numeric (dollar) impact of our choices
to improve/slacken company security.
In comparison, qualitative risk analysis involves taking our own subject
understanding of the risks and categorising them in a matrix of levels
of risk. This is less exact but more practical since we don't always get
an exact probability or cost/impact of an attack.

Q3)
Identification maps the current user to a set of information we have known as
the identity. (e.g. please input your username)
Authentication involves asking the user to verify and prove they are this identity.
(e.g. please input the password)

Q4)
There are three ways to authenticate
something I know (password)
something I am (thumbprint)
something I have (key)

two-factor is using two of these

The given scenario is not two-factor since it is two things that you have.

Q5)
Hash functions have the property that they take an arbitrary length input
and output a fixed size result. They should be easy to compute as well.
It is computationally infeasable to reverse the hash.

Cryptographic hashes have a second property that they are collision resistant
(strong or weak). Strong means it's hard to find two keys that will collide
while weak resistance means it's hard to find another input that gives the
same output as a previously input.

Q6)
It is not cryptographic since it is VERY easy to find a collision of inputs.
