Q2)
Because X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2). But I don't think that's a very good proof.

Q3)
a)
We first find P(Y \leq y). Since Y is the max of X_1 to X_n to achieve
P(Y \leq y) we need P(X_1 \leq y) AND P(X_2 \leq y) ... which gives
(assuming y \in [0,1]) y^n which is our cdf.
Differentiation gives ny^{n-1} which is now our pdf.
b)
Expectation and variance of Y.
Expectation is determined by \int y \times ny^{n-1}
and the variance requires the second moment of the expectation.

Q4)
a)
I THINK you're allowed to use the weak law of large numbers

We must prove P(|y_n - y| > \epsilon) = 0

P(|\frac{1}{n} \sum X_i - p| > \epsilon)
\leq \frac{1}{\epsilon^2} E((\frac{1}{n} \sum X_i - p)^2)

Let's take a look at the expectation of the sample mean. Since each X_i
is iid we can generate each E(X_i) = 1*p + 0*(1-p) = p.
Thus our sum is n*p and we now divide by n to get p. Thus our sample means
is expected to be
