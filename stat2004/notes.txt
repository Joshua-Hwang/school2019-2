Probability theory is concerned with mathematical
models for uncertainty.

Th starting point is the idea of a 'random experiment'

The idea of a random experiment is captured by the
mathematical idea of a *probability space*. It is a core concept
in probability theory and statistics.

Thus to represent a probability space we need a triplet.
(Omega, F, P)
A probability space comprises:
* (Omega) a set of all possible outcomes of the random experiment
* (F) a collection of all possible combinations of events that may occur (the die rolls a prime) (all subsets) (the power set of Omega)
* (P) a function that tells us how likely each even is

The powerset is trivially the event set. It is not equal to however, there
can be event sets smaller than the powerset. (Take the second example on page 02)

Definition of Omega------------------------------------------------
Omega is a non-empty set called the sample space,
F is an event set on Omega
P is a probability of F.

Definition of F------------------------------------------------------
F is nonempty
If A is in F then the complement is also in F. (Complement with respect to Omega)
The union of some unique subsets of F is an element of F.

The power set of Omega is an event set.

Claims-----------------------------------------------------------------
The subsets of an event set are closed under union.
Proof: Consider duplicates A and B, they will cancel to a single element. A union B will give A.
Repeating this sends you to the definition stated eariler. (see page 02-04)

Omega is an element of the event set but also the empty set is an element of the event set.
Proof: Since F is non-empty there exists A in F. We also now the complement of A exists in F.
The union of A and complement of A gives F. We may do this because of the previous proof.

The intersection of subsets is also a subset.
[figure out yourself]

The abritrary set of intersections is also an element of F


Definition of P---------------------------------------------------------
P can be seen as a function that takes an event set and maps it to a real number.
The obvious limites of the function must apply,
P >= 0 for all F
P(Omega) = 1
P(Union of As) = sum of each P(A) (must be unions of disjoint) (is infinite sum/union)

Claims-----------------------------------------------------------------
P(empty set) = 0
Proof: Omega = Omega union empty set.
We convert union into sum and conclude P(empty set) = 0
(I have given up trying to write these down. See 02-07)

P is finitely additive:
If we have A1, A2 ... An which are all dijoint then
the union to sum definition holds for finite n sets.

Claims-----------------------------------------------------------------
P(A) + P(complement A) = 1
Proof: Union of A and complement of A give Omega. Using this union
and definition of P(Omega) we can prove this. (see page 02-04)

If A is a strict subset of B then P(A) <= P(B)
Proof: replaces B as A union (B interset complement A) (see page 02-08)

Definition of random variable------------------------------------------------
A random variable is defined as a mapping from Omega to the reals.
With an extra requirement that the sets {w in Omega : X(w) <= x} for some x are
events in F.

The idea of using an element from Omega seems confusing. I think it's a way
to decouple the idea of events with a score.

A random set of students turn up to class on particular day (Omega)
X is the number of students who attend (Omega to Integer which is a subset of reals)
Y is the average grade of the students who attended (Omega to Reals)

Clearly many random variables can be produced from Omega.

This enitre course assumes the sets {w in Omega : X(w) <= x} for some x are
events in F always holds.

Example:
Let Omega = {(h,w) : h, w > 0} be a sample space for the height and weight of
a random individual. We define a random variable X which is that persons BMI.
X(h,w) = w/h^2
