1. The prob space consists of
Omega (all outcomes)
F (collections of outcomes)
P (the prob function for each F)

Omega is a set of TTTTT...H
F is the power set of Omega
P is summation of 0.5^n where n is the number of Ts

P will change if the coin isn't even

2.
a. Convert intersects to unions with de morgans law.
Make use of the fact that they're complements
b. Convert A\B to A intersect complement B.
Which is pretty easy since both complements and intersects are closed under event set.
c. same as part a but since we have the infinite union as one of the three axioms
d. C = (A union B) intersect (A intersect B)^c

3. Counterexample
Note this is a event space {{1,2},{3,4},{1,2,3,4}}
but {2,3} is a subset of {1,2,3,4}

a. Use the P(A|B) = P(A intersect B)/P(B)
which makes the first step easy.
P(A|B intersect C) * P(B intersect C)
b. base case is the above
kth step is
P(A_{k-1} intersect B) = P(A_{k-1}|B)P(B)
where A was the previous step and B is the new one.
k+1 step
P(A_{k} intersect B) = P(A_{k-1} intersect A_k intersect B) = P(A_{k}|B)P(B)
[ZZZ yeah this wasn't the best way to do it]
c. P(R^c intersect R^c interset ... 4 times) = 10/15 * 9/14 * 8/13 * 7/12

5.
a. P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A intersect B)
