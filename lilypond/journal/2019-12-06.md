# Journal entry for 6 December 2019
## What do I intend to do this week.
- [x] Rewrite the program in C for a small boost in speed.
  - [x] ~Add threadding~
  - [x] Also document it well.

- [x] Measure perfomance
  - [x] Measure comparison in python and C (not useful)
  - [ ] ~Measure speed if all velocities the same~
  - [x] ~If you can compare # threads vs performance~

- [ ] I would like to visualise the graph made from the collisions of grains.

- [ ] Also would like to be able to compare the models. A technique called coupling
  you force two independent models to become dependent so you may easily compare them.
  Run the simulation on the points normally then one where you ignore birth time etc.
  * This should be very easy considering how I've made the new program

- [ ] Figure out what I want to analyse.
  - [ ] Refer to previous journal entry for information

- [ ] ~Look into smart ways of transforming the problem into another form.
Maybe what Thomas had in mind by changing the problem into a multigraph and
finding some kind of optimisation on it.~

- [x] E-mail Christian Hirsch about the algorithm he used

- [ ] ~It would be vey useful to hold the best growing pair minimum~
  - ~Only issue with that is that if the new spair was the minpair.
  Maybe it will allow the cull at spair > minpair.
  To search for minimum iterate over grains instead of all pairs
  since each grain is holding its own minimum.~

- [ ] Figure out some way to identify each circle.
  - Create a color for each circle then provide a legend

- [ ] Since the bottleneck is from integration look for different ways to
parallelize integration.
  - Cython?
  - Split the region into sections and run threads on each?

## What have I done so far.
* E-mailed Christian. Now we wait for his response.

* After completing `attempt2` I found the major issue was with the
method of thinning. Since only a fraction of points get accepted. If I want to
continue improving the perfomance I'll have to consider a different way of
generating points.

* I'm deciding to skip on the threading and other performance measures since
since the performance of the new implementation is great it's the
thinning that's the bottleneck.

* Since the bottleneck was point generation I parallelised the process so I'm
making use of many more cores.

* Noticed there's a small bug in the C program that relates to grains that have
very high growth rates will have to investigate that part of the program.

## What do I intend to do the coming week.
* Research ways to improve thinning or use a different method entirely

## Long term
* Look into extending it to 3D (which shouldn't be that hard)

* Alternative shapes and distance metrics (manhattan distance)

##  Lingering questions.
* I'm currently unsure of where to take the project next.
  * Pursuing a proof is very challneging and something Thomas isn't exactly looking for
  * Finding ways to improve the algorithm because it's currently running at n^4 time
    * Thomas's suggestion seems like a nice way of doing things
    * Maybe analyse my new method to see it's big O performance
* An issue with the current model is that it's bounded by the dimensions we define.
  In reality this model should have an infinite number of circles. Is there any way
  we can approximate this behaviour? Some kind of limiting behaviour.
