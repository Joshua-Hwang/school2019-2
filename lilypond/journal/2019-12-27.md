# Journal entry for 27 December 2019
## What do I intend to-do this week.
- [ ] Take a look at dithered images because "ink bleed"

- [ ] Just create a new program that `extends.py` the solved system

- [ ] Investigate better visualisers.
  * Also something that is interactive
  * You'll have to use the vector graphics since pdfs like vectors

- [ ] Need to finish up the work on percolation.

- [ ] If we assume no extra births we can actually cull all collisions
that occur further away than closest grain. Not sure how important
this culling will be to performance (could it be magnitudes better?)
  * Would need to look up what the average "local group" is for a grain.

- [ ] Read Existence, Uniqueness, and Algorithmic Computation of General Lilypond
Systems (Heveling & Last, 2005)
  * They claim to have an algorithm (for the basic Lilypond model) that
  takes n^2

- [ ] Now that we've extended the `.lp` format we can now run this on moss
to determine percolation.
  - [ ] Consider the "standard lilypond model" with homogeneous intensity 1.
  We'll try different sized areas but for the most part we'll not consider
  dynamically born grains nor different velocities.

## What have I done so far.

## What do I intend to do the coming week.

## Long term
* Look into extending it to 3D (which shouldn't be that hard)
