# Journal entry for 13 December 2019
## What do I intend to-do this week.
- [ ] Email Christian about the method I've generated and if it's interesting.
"My professor/coordinator thinks there might be a paper in it"

- [ ] Take a look at dithered images because "ink bleed"

- [ ] Explore boundary conditions
  - [ ] Hit the boundary
  - [ ] Loop back (periodic boundary conditions)
    * To do this maybe try finding if the looped coordinates 
    give a better distance. Since distance is fixed we should be fine to
    store that value.
      * Might be a good idea to define a macro which determined which distance
      algorithm to use.
  - [ ] Cylinder geometry (one of the boundaries is solid)
  * With percolation you must have hard boundaries

- [ ] Increasing the boundary does nothing. Just increase the intensity.
Thus ensure the boundaries are 1x1

- [ ] Just creeate a new program that `extends.py` the solved system

- [ ] Generate a worse case system
  - You'll have to think long and hard about what would be our worst case
  - [ ] Create a program that can generate one of these worst cases easily given
  the number of points desired.

- [ ] Plot performance on a log graph to get gradients
  - [ ] Create a program and do the samples from more to less and less to more to check
  for memory optimisations
  - [ ] Parallelise the approximation script
  - [ ] Look for what might be wrong in the Python script
    * Is it because I'm using a `set` data structure?
  - [ ] Check that our C program is actually n^3 might actually be better.

- [ ] Work on extending `attempt2` where we improve our \*.lp format and
add entries for connections
  * We still define the initial collision in each row since the first collision
  is special
  * Our `solvelp` should not delete the pairs but rather store them in an array
  to be ordered later.
  * We can redefine the initial collisions in the later section
  if we want but that's time and memory
  optimisations that we've lost.
    * Once implemented the delta increase run some experiments to numerically
    determine our curve or possible deltas to achieve percolation.

- [ ] Investigate better visualisers.
  * Also something that is interactive
  * You'll have to use the vector graphics since pdfs like vectors

- [x] Consider ways to turn the approximate algorithm into a matrix.

## What have I done so far.
* I'm not convinced the matrix idea has any legs. It seems as bad as what we've
been doing already. The approximation might benefit slightly from threading.

## What do I intend to do the coming week.

## Long term
* Look into extending it to 3D (which shouldn't be that hard)
