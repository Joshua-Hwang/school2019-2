# Physical Metallurgy Principles 4th ed.
## Chapter 1 structure of metals
Doesn't seem to have anything important.
Talks more about the atoms which is something I can't work with.

## Chapter 8 Annealing
Seems to be more about cold working metal.

## Chapter 14 Solidification of metals

## Chapter 15 Nucleation and Growth Kinetics

## Additional notes (From word of mouth)
Apparently difficult to determine where the grains should start from.

There probably have been simulations of the nucleation process in the past
but doing so is very taxing especially with all the variables.

Nucleation doesn't happen on its own (usually) instead solid bits (stuff) is
added to the mixture so nucleation can happen off it. Without these solid bits
to nucleate off the nucleation will usually happen at the rim of the casting
bowl.

Read the Hall-Petch Relationship
This relates to the strength of a material given an initial base strength
a strengthening coefficient (inherent to the material) and the average grain
diameter throughout the metal.
The model seems to extrapolate that smaller is always better but given the
absolute lower limit of size in the real world we're limited by that.
Also keep in mind that this relationship was found empirically and actually
fails in the much smaller regions. Getting too small will actually result in
more failures.

Most simulations are conducted in 2D since 3D is hard. Perhaps the simplified
model we're presenting has to ability to be easily extended to 3D.
