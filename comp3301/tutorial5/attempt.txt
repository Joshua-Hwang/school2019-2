8.2
Consider a system in which a program can be separated into two parts: code and
data. The CPU knows whether it wants an instruction (instruction fetch) or data
(data fetch or store). Therefore, two base–limit register pairs are provided:
one for instructions and one for data.
The instruction base–limit register pair is automatically read-only,
so programs can be shared
among different users.

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this scheme.

An advantage is that there is a level of security between execution and reading.
We ensure that an attacker cannot plant data and then execute it.

8.4
Consider a logical address space of 64 pages of 1024 words each, mapped onto a
physical memory of 32 frames.
a) how many bits are there in the logical address
There are 1024*64 = 65536 words which means 2^16 possibilities which
needs 16 bits.

b) Since frames have the same number of words as pages (otherwise mapping don't
work) we have log2(32*1024) = 15 bits.
