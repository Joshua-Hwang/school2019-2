My answer gave benefits of system calls (which I would say are alright)
The answer was, "to allow uesr-level processes to request services of the
operating system."

My answer is slightly wrong. It's so we can run common system operations withou
having to write these basic system programs ourselves.
"System programs can be thought of as bundles of useful system calls.
They provide basic functionality to users so that users do not need to
write their own programs to solve common problems."
