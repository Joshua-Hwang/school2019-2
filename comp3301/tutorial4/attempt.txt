I did it using what I have in my book. Not sure if there's an easier way though.

Denote a timeline and the tasks on top

\| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
-+---+---+---+---+---+
0| 20|   |   |   |   |
1| 19| 6 |   |   |   |
2|   | 5 | 2 |   |   |
3| 19| 4 |   |   |   |
4| 18|   |   |   |   |

It's preferable to do this ON the lines of a workbook instead of the spaces
helps clearly define the time.
